              We're creating a new model for digital publishing. One that supports nuance, complexity, and vital
              storytelling without giving in to the incentives of advertising.

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-serif mt-8 mb-4">Our Story</h2>
  
            <p className="mb-6">
              Medium was founded in 2012 as a response to a publishing landscape that incentivized quantity over quality,
              headlines over substance, and breaking news over considered analysis.
            </p>
  
            <p className="mb-6">
              We set out to build a platform that defined a new model for media on the internetâ€”one designed to serve
              people, not advertisers. Where quality, not clicks, is the goal.
            </p>
  
            <h2 className="text-2xl font-serif mt-8 mb-4">Our Team</h2>
  
            <p className="mb-6">
              We're a team of passionate writers, engineers, designers, and thinkers who are dedicated to building a
              better publishing platform. We believe in the power of great writing to illuminate, educate, and connect us.
